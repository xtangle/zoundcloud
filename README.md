## Description

A Google Chrome extension that adds download buttons to SoundCloud web pages. 

<img src="https://github.com/xtangle/ZoundCloud/blob/master/docs/img1.png" width="800">

This extension will add download buttons to:

* Individual track pages.
* User pages (will download all of a user's tracks).
* Playlist pages (will download the playlist).
* Tracks that are contained in scrollable lists.

When a download is initiated, it attempts to download a track in its uploaded format (i.e. highest quality) and will only
resort to the streamable 128kb mp3 version if no better quality is available.

Metadata information and cover art is automatically added to files in .mp3 format (in ID3v2.3).

All tracks will be downloaded to the default Downloads folder:

* Tracks are downloaded with the name `track_title`.
* Playlists are downloaded to a folder with the name `user_name - playlist_name`.
* User tracks are downloaded to a folder with the name `user_name`.

If a file with the same name exists, it will not be overwritten.

Special characters in the title will be replaced by an underscore (unless it's a tilda, in which
case it is replaced by a dash (-) symbol).

## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store

- Install from the [extension page here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zoundcloud-downloader/bhnpokjikdldjiimbmoakkfekcnpkkij).

- Click `Load Unpacked` and choose the folder where the contents were extracted to in the first step. 

### From Source

The extension is created as a Node.js project and does not come pre-packaged. 
To build, make sure Node.js (version >= 7.6) and yarn is installed.
